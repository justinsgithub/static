# Data Types

## primitive data types

- a data types behavior may vary slighly between languages
- primitive data types each require a certain amount of fixed memory
- the fixed memory that makes up a primitive data type is the amount of 0s and 1s it uses
- a single 0 or a bit 
- a boolean is represented by a single bit ( a 1 or a 0 )
- in boolean a 0 = False and a 1 = True
- numbers within the same datatype take up the same memory no matter if one is higher than the other
- all data breaks down to 0s and 1s 
- programming languages abstract the 0s and 1s away from us 
- primitive types can also be called basic or value types
- primitive types are a fixed size because their size does not depend on the value inside if them
- there are data types that can be built out of primitive data types
- strings are an example of a datatype built from a primitive type because they are made from chars


### primitive data type list

- byte
- short
- int
- long
- float
- double
- boolean
- char

### numbers

- the difference between number data types is the range of values they can store

| type     |              range                 | bits |
| -------- | ---------------------------------- | ---- |
| short    | -32,768 to 32,767                  | 16   |
| int      | ~-2 billion to -2 billion          | 32   |
| long     | -(2<sup>63</sup>) to 2<sup>63</sup>| 64   |
| float    | 7 decimal digits                   | 32   |
| double   | 16 decimal digits                  | 64   |
| signed   | negative or postive                | any  |
| unsigned | postive                            | double unsigned version |

### boolean values

- a boolean is a true or false value 
- named after Goerge Boolean
- used perform yes / no logical operations 
- we give decision making boolean values everyday

### characters

- used for storing a single letter or non-number in code

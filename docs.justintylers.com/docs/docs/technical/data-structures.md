# Data Structures  


- data structures are like containers that hold multiple pieces of data
- data structures give us a way to - 
     - organize data
     - store data
     - access data

- the amount of memory a data structure uses varies unlike primitive data types
- the amount of memory a data structure uses depends on factors such as - 
    - how they are allocated 
    - how they are initialized
    - how they are maintained 

- reference types are data store the address of a datatype in memory by using a pointer to reference it 

## list of data structures

> non-exhaustive

- arrays 
- linked lists 
- stacks
- queues 
- hash table
- trees
- heaps
- graphs

## organizing data

- just like organizing a room there are many different ways to organize data
- there are many factors that play a factor in planning a room's organization
- in a room we organize things based on the type of item it is 
- a room will hold different types of items depending on what the room is used for 
- we will also factor in the type of facility a room is in when we go to organize it 
- another factor that might effect organizing a room is if it is a house or garage and the average weather at it's location
- this is the same type of complexity that goes into data structures
- data structures give us an easier way to assign variables and keep track of items as opposed to creating separate binding statements for each variable


## strings

> a non-primitive data type made up of the primitive character type 

- a string is a data type made from chars
- since a string is made out of characters it is not considered a primitive data type
- a string is usually signified by surrounding text in quotes
- an array is commonly used in real life to name things 
- strings are used to give us names as well as things like the title of a book 
- the title of a book is made up of a string of individual characters

## arrays

- a collection of elements 
- each element is an item identified by an index / key
- this could be like a collection of books that are stored on a shelf
- each spot on the shelf is labeled with a number starting at 0

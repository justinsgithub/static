## about these docs

* this documentation is for myself to help reinforce my learnings
* this project is also to help practice documentation / organization / learning ability

!!! important
    - code style in this documentation may vary
    - here are some rules that may not vary
    - "you" shall be used very minimally, if ever
    - "." shall be used only in code examples
    -  "," should be shall be used thoughtfully
    - capitalizations will be used only in main headers, names, or code examples
    - bullet points are used religiously to help keep content to the point

## daily reminders

* does this object / item / task truly service me? ( minimalism )
* is my current action / activity bringing me closer to my goals? ( productivity )
* compulsive actions lead to destructive behavior
* think on an idea before taking action no matter how good the idea seems (even what sounds like a "no-brainer")

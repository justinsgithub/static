# Learning Docs


## learning docs objective

* to help reinforce my learnings
* to help practice documentation / organization / learning ability

!!! important
    - code style in this documentation may vary
    - here are some rules that may not vary
    - "you" shall be used very minimally, if ever
    - "." shall be used only in code examples
    -  "," shall not be used carelessly
    - capitalizations will only be used for pages title, names, or code examples

## daily reminders

* focus on accomplishing a single task / solving one problem at at time no matter how simple it seems
* trying to multitask or focus on more than 1 thing is like trying to brush your teeth and hair at the same time
* compulsive actions lead to destructive behavior
* think on an idea before taking action no matter how good it seems, even "no-brainers"
* does this object / item / task truly service me? ( minimalism )
* is my current action / activity bringing me closer to my goals? ( productivity )
